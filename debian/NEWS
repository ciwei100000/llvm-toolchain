llvm-toolchain-3.9 (1:3.9.1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Libraries ship with ELF symbols versions. This will address the issue of
    a binary using to different versions of LLVM in parallel
    This also means that every library using LLVM library or clang library
    will have to be relinked against this new version
    Thanks to Rebecca N. Palmer for the change (Closes: #848368)
